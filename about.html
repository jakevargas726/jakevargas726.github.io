  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Born and raised on Long Island, my passion for music began at a young age. I started taking piano lessons at the age of seven, and have 
    since learned many other instruments. I began producing music when I was fifteen, and haven't stopped even though my life has taken me 
    in many different directions.</p>
  
  <p>I attended New York University and received A Bachelor's of Music in Music Technology, focusing my studies on sound for film and 
    television. I also took courses in studio production, electronic theory, and computer science.</p>
  
  <p>Since my graduation from school, I have picked up numerous new skills, including HTML and CSS, Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver, and 
    have further developed my skills in Excel and JavaScript. As a consultant, I have worked in many different roles, including as an 
  administrative assistant, web developer, and project manager.</p>
  
  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
  <p>I love cheesy 80s music and smooth jazz, can solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute, and am a die-hard New York Islanders fan.</p>
